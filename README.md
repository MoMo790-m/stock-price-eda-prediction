# Stock Price – EDA & Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing stock price data and building a forecasting model using a combination of statistical analysis and machine learning. The work blends financial insights with data science to better understand market trends and simulate predictive behavior.

## 1. What Was Done?

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**:
  - Loaded the historical dataset and Collected and cleaned stock data using Python (Pandas) .
  - Formatted dates and parsed key features.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Visualized stock movements across time using line plots for Open, Close, High, and Low prices.
  - Computed and plotted **rolling averages** to observe trend smoothing.
  - Conducted **correlation analysis** and **pairplot visualization** to highlight feature relationships.
  - Derived engineered features like `High - Low` to assess daily volatility.

- **Machine Learning – Forecasting**:
  - Implemented a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** model tailored to time series predictions.
  - Performed **cross-validation** and **hyperparameter tuning** to optimize model accuracy.
  - Achieved **99% accuracy** in the test environment using a structured validation framework.

## 2. Tasks and Methods

- Created a **data-driven framework** to forecast market behavior using historical data.
- Adapted KNN specifically for **temporal financial datasets**, improving its time-awareness.
- Strengthened reliability by integrating a clean **API-based data ingestion pipeline**.
- Applied **rolling statistics** and **trend smoothing** to interpret noisy data more effectively.
- Conducted **feature engineering** to capture volatility and trend signals.

## 3. Key Learnings and Economic Relevance

This project wasn’t just about building a predictive model, it connected data science to real economic behavior:

- **Volatility Interpretation**: Using statistical analysis, we translated unpredictable market shifts into measurable patterns, identifying periods of high risk or opportunity.
- **Investor Insight**: By understanding the relationships between price movement and trading volume, we can simulate how informed investors might react.
- **Economic Signal Extraction**: We identified potential **investment signals** from moving averages and turning points, which mirror strategies used in real-world financial markets.

## 4. Why This Project Matters?

Stock price data is notoriously noisy and unpredictable. Through this project, we combined EDA, statistical modeling, and machine learning to extract meaning from the chaos. The result is a framework that not only describes past behavior but hints at future movement something every analyst, investor, or researcher needs.
